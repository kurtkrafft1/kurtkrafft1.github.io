									<h2>About Me</h2>
								</header>
								<hr />
								<p> I first started my coding journey halfway through 2019. At the time I was pursuing dreams of music, but was also in a transformative time in my life. I decided to give website development a shot because I knew I wanted something creative but also challenging. I started doing 1 hour a day of coding in August 2019 and I enjoyed it. It wasn't until I first started at Nashville Software School where that enjoyment became genuine interest and passion. </p>
								<p>Nashville Software School has made such a profound impact on my life. The amount I learned in 6 months is truly astonishing. I have learned to code so many amazing websites, and have improved my already strong skills as a leader, but also increased my skill level as a follower. I enjoy the challenge of class, but am eager to see the challenges that lie ahead.</p>

										<h2>PhotoLab</h2>
										<p>Client-side web app that replicates a  minimalistic photosharing website</p>
									</header>
									<hr />
									<p>My goal for this project was to build a website that resembles Instagram, but has a friend request model a opposed to a following model. I also wanted to test myself and was able to utilize a photo-cropping react library which was really fun. Note: this doesn't have real authentication so don't add any private information. </p>

Also, if you click the Github link it will just take you to PhotoLab github lol hahahahahahahahaha it is really fun to imporoves write, have you ever tried it?</p>
