										<h2>React "Nutshell"</h2>
										<p>This was the second major group project we had at school. It is called Nutsdhell because it combines everything we have learned so far.</p>
									</header>
									<hr />
									<p>This is very similar to the other nutshell project, but we were able to use react which is such a game changer. This project helped finalize my skills using hooks and useEffect in React, but also challenged me as a follower and a team player. I was in charge of events, "authentication", the Home page and then create account page. I had a lot of fun duringn this project and made new friends as well as new brain cells! It also introduced me to cloudinary and having the ability to upload images from your computer or phone was super challenging and fun, furthermore it prompted me to want to learn how to integrate an image crop function in my front-end capstone</p>

										<h2>Vanilla javascript "Nutshell"</h2>
										<p>This was the first major group project we had at school. It is called Nutsdhell because it combines everything we have learned so far.</p>
									</header>
									<hr />
									<p>This project was very fun for me because I thrive in group enviroments. Looking back it was even more exciting because it was all using vanilla javascript which is crazy to me after learning react. I was specifically handling the friends and message board aspect of this. I really enjoyed my team and felt like I played a strong and proficient role as leader. It was great to learn a lot as well from one of my classmates who introduced me to modals and semantic ui (previously I was using bootstrap). One thing I would like to point out is that typically the groups had 4 people, however, we were only allotted 3, so that was a fun challenge as well. </p>

										<h2>Ternary Traveler</h2>
										<p>This was a one day challenge to show basic CRUD funcitonality</p>
									</header>
									<hr />
									<p>This was one of the first projects I have made where I was mildly proud of. I completed this in about 4 hours, it was all coded in vanilla Javascript and styled with basic css and flexbox. I really loved the race against the clock and see that I can perform well in time crunches. Looking back at this project there are obviously some things I would like to change, but I would say it is really good for only being in school for a month.</p>
